## **Introduction to Cybersecurity & Linux Basics**
## **1 : The CIA Triad**

The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in cybersecurity that outlines three core principles to protect information:

* Confidentiality:  Ensuring that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals. This means preventing unauthorized disclosure of data. Think of it like keeping your personal diary locked up.
* Integrity:  Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of information. This means preventing unauthorized modifications or alterations to data. Imagine your bank account statement - you wouldn't want someone to change the balance!
* Availability:  Guaranteeing that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed. This means preventing disruptions or outages that would make data unavailable. Think about your phone's internet connection - you need it to be available when you need to make calls or use apps.

## **COMMON CYBERSECURITY THREATS**
* Phishing: This is a social engineering attack where attackers try to trick you into giving them sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. They might send you emails or messages that look like they're from a legitimate source, but they're actually fake.
* Malware:  This refers to malicious software designed to harm your computer or steal your data. It can come in various forms, including viruses, worms, and Trojans. 
* Ransomware:  A type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom payment to unlock them. This can be a very serious threat because it can lock you out of your data and potentially cost you a lot of money.


## **SETTING UP A CYBERSECURITY LAB**
1. Virtualization Software

* VirtualBox:  A free and open-source virtualization software. Download it from [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/). 
* VMware Workstation Player:  A popular virtualization software with a free version available. Download it from [https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html).

2. Download and Install Linux Distribution

* Kali Linux:  A Linux distribution specifically designed for penetration testing and security auditing. Download it from [https://www.kali.org/](https://www.kali.org/).
* Ubuntu:  A user-friendly and popular Linux distribution. Download it from [https://ubuntu.com/](https://ubuntu.com/).

3. Setting Up Your Virtual Machine

1. Open VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player.
2. Create a new virtual machine:  Select "New" or "Create New Virtual Machine."
3. Choose the operating system: Select "Linux" and the specific distribution (Kali Linux or Ubuntu).
4. Specify hard disk size: Allocate sufficient space for your virtual machine (at least 20 GB is recommended).
5. Start the virtual machine: Once the installation is complete, start the virtual machine and follow the on-screen instructions to install the Linux distribution.
